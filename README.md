🌤️ Weather Forecasting with Machine Learning (Upper Marlboro, MD)
This project explores the use of machine learning to predict future weather patterns using historical data from Upper Marlboro, Maryland. I gathered daily weather records from January 1, 1975, to June 28, 2025 on the NOAA, including precipitation, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature. Using Python, I applied regression models to analyze trends and forecast upcoming weather conditions. The project highlights the potential of data-driven methods to support more accurate, long-term weather predictions.

🔗 Technologies used: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib
